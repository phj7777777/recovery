# Sudoku
Android Sudoku game created with Android Studios.

## Features
- The application starts a new game when the user opens the application.
- To fill in an empty spot in the grid, click on one of the buttons (1-9) and then click on the spot in the grid.
- The application will tell you if the move is illegal. A popup window appears when the player makes an illegal move telling the them that they have to try again.
- The player can switch between games by clicking the New Game button.
- The player wins by filling in all empty spots in the grid correctly (according to the official Sudoku game rules). A popup window appears when the player wins the game. 

## Polish
- I separated each grid item with black lines to make each individual grid item stand out to the user.
- I added popup windows for illegal moves, the win-state, and the loose-state.
- I created buttons with round corners.
- I added a black image as the application background.
- I changed the colors of the application theme.
